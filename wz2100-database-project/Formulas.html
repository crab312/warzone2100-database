                            Most of the things in Warzone are easy to calculate, but some of them can be pretty confusing. Here are some of the formulas we use to calculate things.

                        Nearly all calculations in formulas are done with integers.
                        This means that numbers are nearly always <em>rounded down</em> to the nearest integer.
                        This includes damage bonuses, weight multipliers, damage multipliers, experience bonuses, accuracy bonuses (down to the nearest percent).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        However, note that time is usually rounded down to the nearest 0.1 second, and distance is usually rounded down to the nearest 1/128 tile.

                        <p>Ever wonder how damage is calculated in Warzone? If you just want to know if armor is subtractive or multiplicative, it's subtractive:</p>

                        <p><span class="box">DAMAGE</span> = <span class="box">BASE DAMAGE</span> − <span class="box">ARMOR</span>
                        <br /><em>or</em>
                            <span class="box">DAMAGE</span> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> × <span class="box">BASE DAMAGE</span>
                        <br />whichever is higher.</p>
                        <p>There are 2 kinds of armor: <span style="color:blue">kinetic</span> and <span style="color:red">thermal</span>. 
                        <br />Kinetic armor protects tanks from "physical" damage (ie from machineguns, cannons, rockets, etc.). 
                        Thermal armor is used to protect the tank body from "heat" damage type weapons such as flamers, lasers, thermite bombs, etc.</p>

                        <p>
                        But to know exactly how much damage you're going to do, you need to know how to calculate base damage.

                        <p>
                        Damage is <span class="box">BASE DAMAGE</span> − <span class="box">ARMOR</span>, or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of <span class="box">BASE DAMAGE</span>, whichever is higher, rounded down (The exception is when rounding down would make damage 0, in which case damage is rounded up to 1).

                        Green's Tank Killer Scorpion Half-Tracks shoots Yellow's Heavy Cannon Python Tracks. Green has HESH Rocket Warhead, and Yellow has Dense Composite Alloys.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Tank Killer (an anti-tank weapon) has 180 damage. HESH Rocket Warhead gives 275%, and anti-tank weapons do 120% damage against tracks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <span class="box">BASE DAMAGE</span> = 180 × 275% × 120% = 524.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Tank Killer is a kinetic weapon, and Python has 20 Kinetic Armor. Dense Composite Alloys upgrades 220%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <span class="box">ARMOR</span> = 20 × 220% = 44
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        524 − 44 (480) is greater than 524 × <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> (174), so the tank killer does 480 damage each time it hits (Notice that it fires two salvos; if they both hit, the tank killer does 960 damage, a significant proportion of the 2260 HP after upgrades that the heavy cannon tank has).

                            This speed is in units of world-coordinates per second. There are 128 world-coordinates in a tile, so, for instance, a unit with a speed of 128 would go at a speed of one tile per second.

                            That "Terrain Multiplier" is pretty important. You'd expect it to be 1× for all propulsions flat terrain, but it's actually 2.5× for VTOLs.
